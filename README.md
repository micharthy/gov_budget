I've created an engaging and educational budget allocation game that allows users to compare their spending priorities with actual government expenditures. Here are the key features:

# Main Features:

**Interactive Budget Allocation**:
Intuitive sliders for each budget category
Real-time remaining budget tracking
Visual progress bar showing allocation percentage
Information tooltips explaining each category

**Comprehensive Results Screen**:
Side-by-side bar chart comparing user allocations vs. actual spending
Detailed breakdown for each category with visual comparison bars
Color-coded differences (green for increases, red for decreases)
Alignment score showing how closely the user's priorities match reality

**Educational Summary**:
Personalized feedback based on alignment score
Highlights of biggest differences in priorities
Educational context about government budgeting

**Responsive Design**:
Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
Smooth animations and transitions
Modern, clean interface with gradient backgrounds
Technical Implementation:
Pure JavaScript (no frameworks required)
Bootstrap for responsive layout and components
Chart.js for data visualization
Custom CSS with CSS variables for consistent theming
Toast notifications for user feedback
Component-based structure for maintainability
